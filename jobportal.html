            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The task of helping job seekers find suitable jobs through a job portal mobile application is a multifaceted challenge 
            that involves addressing several key issues. Some of the challenges that you can consider in your case study are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A job portal app needs a good filter system to make job search easy. It should sort listings by title, location, 
                salary, and experience level.</li>
                <li>Job portals should provide customized job recommendations based on user search history and job preferences.</li>
            </ol>

        research on the real estate industry and competitors' websites to identify best practices and trends.</p>
        <ol>

            <li>Synthesis the findings</li>
            <li>Ideating the solution</li>

       </div>
       <div class="solution-container">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>A job portal app should prioritize user experience and safety by including a strong filtering system for easy job searching
          based on individual preferences.<br>The app should sync with employer databases for accurate job listings and provide 
          personalized suggestions based on user preferences and search history.</p>
